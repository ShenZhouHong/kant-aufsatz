## Access to the compiled PDF
In order to view the compiled essay PDF, visit the 'releases' page on GitHub. A Download is provided at that location.

## Compiling document
In order to compile latex source files, run `make` in the terminal:
```
cd latex
make
make clean
```

Note: for any partial compiles where compilation fails at a certain point, you
should run `make clean` followed by make again. Trying to run make after a
failed compile would result in additional errors.

### Dependencies
This template uses a makefile to compile the latex source files. The makefile
uses `latexmk`, which runs latex the correct number of times. This is because
due to the presense of figures, tables, and biblatex databases, latex needs to
be called multiple times in some cases. Latexmk should be included in your
latex installation, but if it is now, you may download it here:

Additionally, this template uses XeLaTeX by default, as it allows the inclusion
of unicode characters in the latex source files. If XeLaTeX is not installed, or
plain LaTeX is required, simply alter the `makefile` at the appropriate call:

```
# MAIN LATEXMK RULE
$(source_name).pdf: $(source_name).tex
  ...
	latexmk -pdf -xelatex -use-make $<
```

XeLaTeX allows one to use foreign characters like ü or æ natively in the latex
source files, though. So it's probably a good idea to install XeLaTeX:
