# Notes on the Prolegomena to Any Future metaphysics
The *Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics* is a summary/attempted popularisation of the transcendental metaphysics espoused in Kant's *Critique of Pure Reason*. One of the reasons that Kant was able to create a vastly smaller and condensed work, is because the Prolegomena is an *Analytic* approach to the *elaboration* of a new transcendental metaphysics, as opposed to the *synthetic* approach which is required in the *creation* of a new metaphysics.

The *Prolegomena* utilises a pedagogical technique in which Kant proposes several *General Question* and a *Transcendental Question* (with many parts), to which he answers with his exposition.

The questions are:

## General Question of the Prolegomena
* Is metaphysics possible at all?
* How is cognition from pure reason possible?

## The Main Transcendental Question
* How is pure mathematics possible?
* How is pure natural science possible?
* How is metaphysics in general possible?
* How is metaphysics as a science possible?

Essentially, the Prolegomena is a demonstration that the above questions are only satisfactorily answered by the transcendental metaphysics proposed in Kant's *Critique of Pure Reason*.

## Preliminary Remark to the Dialectic of Pure Reason
The Dialectic of Pure Reason is the part in Kant's Critique in which he examines how 'pure reason' (i.e. reason that is applied to transcendental concepts, abstracted away from an object) -- easily leads to falsehoods. He calls this process dialectical, defining the word in synonymy with sophistry.

However, the dialectical outcomes of Pure Reason (when misapplied) are not mere, simple falsehoods - but they are dialectical, insofar that they yield propositions which can both be false.

These propositions (which Kant gives the name of paralogisms, antinomies, and the 'theological ideal' depending on their topic) are like epistemological sirens which underpin many 'standard' metaphysical questions.
