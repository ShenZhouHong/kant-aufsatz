# Introductory Notes to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason
Kant's *Critique of Pure Reason* takes the following overarching structure. There are two main parts, the *Transcendental Doctrine of Elements*, which present the *elements* of Kant's Transcendental Idealism. Followed by the *Transcendental Doctrine of the Method*, which we do not address in our studies. Hence, we will focus only on the *Transcendental Doctrine of Elements*.

## General Structure of the Critique
* Transcendental Aesthetic
* Transcendental Logic
  * Transcendental Analytic
  * Transcendental Dialectic

Kant's Transcendental Idealism postulates two (three?) faculties which underlie the human condition (the state in which humans are knowing beings). We have:

* The faculty of sensibility, which begets sensations
* The faculty of understanding, which begets concepts
* (The faculty of reason, which begets images)

In which the study of sensibility is the science of *Aesthetics*, and the study of understanding is the science of *Logic*. (The study of reason is the science of *Dialectic*).

## What is Transcendent, versus Transcendental?
In our discourse upon Kant's *Critique of Pure Reason*, it is important to understand the distinction between the *mundane* (my words), the *transcendent*, and the *transcendental*. For the faculties in which we are exploring have mundane forms (i.e. regular aesthetic, logic, dialectic) -- which is not the topic of Kant's Critique at all. Instead, Kant focuses on the *Transcendent* and the *Transcendental*.

### Transcendent Metaphysics (This is the Bad One!)
*Transcendent* and *Transcendental* are not equivalent words, but rather Kant makes a very careful distinction between them. *Transcendent* Metaphysics is the result of the fallacious, inappropriate application of (reason? faulty categories?) towards a priori concepts. Such a pursuit is by necessity in vain, for transcendent metaphysics contains inherent contradictions that result in paralogisms and antinomies - logical propositions in which both possible answers can be false at the same time.

### Transcendental Metaphysics (This is the Kantian, ergo Good One)
In contrast, *Transcendental* metaphysics is the careful, disciplined examination of the *a priori* foundations behind the human faculties of sensibility, understanding, (and reason), followed the the application of said *a priori* foundations. As our very means of using these faculties (e.g. that of sensation, or understanding) is dependent on these a priori foundations, by necessity we cannot be lead astray here. At least, this is the Kantian thesis.

## What is are the types of knowledge (A Priori, A Posteriori, Synthetic, Analytic)
In order to understand Kant's *Transcendental Analytic* (i.e. the process in which he examines the underlying a priori foundations behind the human faculties of understanding, sensibility, and reason), we must first understand the Kantian distinction between the forms of knowledge. Kant distinguishes knowledge on two distinctions:
* The A Priori/A Posteriori distinction
* The Analytic/Synthetic distinction

### The A Priori/A Posteriori distinction
A priori knowledge is knowledge that is prior to sensibility, whereas a posteriori is knowledge after sensability.

### The Analytic/Synthetic distinction
Analytic knowledge is knowledge that is yielded through the analysis (examination by parts) of a concept, while synthetic knowledge is yielded through the synthesis of different (and non-self-containing) concepts.

# Notes on the Body of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason
Now that we have summarised the main concepts which are instrumental in understanding Kant's Transcendental Metaphysics, it is time to comment on the body of his Critique itself. We will go through the two main sections, corresponding to the three human faculties of sensibility, understanding, and reason.

## Notes on the Transcendental Aesthetic

## Notes on the Transcendental Logic (Analytic)

## Notes on the Transcendental Logic (Dialectic)
