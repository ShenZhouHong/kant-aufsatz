% Includes content body. If the essay is very long, it might make sense to split
% the content across multiple .tex files, and include them all here, e.g.
%\input{sections/preamble.tex}
\include{sections/intro.tex}
\include{sections/body.tex}
\include{sections/conclusion.tex}
\include{sections/endpage.tex}
